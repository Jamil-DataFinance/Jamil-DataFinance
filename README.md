## Projects

### Five-Year Financial Projections for Placeholder Innovations

This is my first project, where I created a comprehensive financial model to forecast 5 years of financial statements for a placeholder company. The model includes:

- A three-statement financial model
- A visualization dashboard
- Detailed schedules for in-depth financial analysis
